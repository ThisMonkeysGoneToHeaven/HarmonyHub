Google Gemini para generate making fun of user's music taste <br>
Think about followers and following and how it's going to be implemented <br>
Think about how will the feed of common artist be generated <br>
Spotify Accounts should be unique for all users <br>

### Further Explorations and Improvements

Think about implementing an external rate limiter wherever required. Currently rate limiting email requests sent within five minutes, move this functionality to external limiter. <br>
